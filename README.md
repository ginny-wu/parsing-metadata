# parsing-metadata (2019)

## Background ##
As part of an interview assignment, I was asked to provide my opinion on which startups I believed to have the highest potential in the company's portfolio.
They directed me to one single page on their website that contained all this information.

## Approach ##
I decided that I would identify the most promising startups by looking at trending industries and verticals, so I was interested in seeing which startups fell into which categories.
Instead of going to the page and manually counting tags, I wondered if I'd be able to extract this data by parsing through the page's metadata.

Though I had never used VBA before, I was aware of its utility and had parsed data extracted from the web before in my university programming classes. 
Thus, I taught myself how to make my first macro.
